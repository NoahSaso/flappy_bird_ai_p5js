flappy_bird_ai_p5js
===================

(Crudely designed) flappy bird replica used to train an AI using the [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) algorithm (with [Neataptic](https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic)) written in p5js.
Base game is a version of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgA1d_E-jY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgA1d_E-jY). Shoutout to Daniel Shiffman for being awesome.
